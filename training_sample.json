Beat up an egg until light and mix it with half a pint of cold milk. Pour this gradually into the flour, beating all the time. Grease a baking tin, pour the batter in and bake in a rather hot oven for half an hour. When done, cut in squares and serve with roast beef. If liked, a little fat may be mixed with the batter or a little dripping poured over during the baking. Batter pudding, to serve as a pudding course, may be made as above, but omitting salt and adding sugar and a few currants; pour the mixture in to buttered cups, and steam the puddings for three-quarters of an hour.",
